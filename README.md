## Ecology
### Populations, Community and Ecosystem
#### 1. ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC FACTORS
##### 1.1 ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT
* Light intensity
* Temperature
* Water availability
* Oxygen content
* Salinity
* pH
###### Tolerance Range
* A species' **tolerance range** is the range within which the species can exist
* Near the **upper and lower limits** of the tolerance range, individuals _experience stress_, which will reduce the species' **health, rate of growth and reproduction**
###### Optimal Range
* A species' **optimal range** is the range within which the species is _best adapted_
##### 1.2 BIOTIC ENVIRONMENT
* Role of each species of organism is referred to its **niche**
* Every niche is different
* **Interrelationships** between different species help to **keep the balance in an ecosystem**.
###### Symbiotic Relationships
Interactions betwen organisms include:
* **Predation** - a carnivorous / omnivorous organism (predator) feeds on another organism (prey)
* **Parasitism** - one species (parasitie) lives at the expense of another species (host)
* **Mutualism** - two species living together, with both benefiting each other
* **Commensalism** - two species living together, where one species benefits but the other is neither harmed or benefited.
